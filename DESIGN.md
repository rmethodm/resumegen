## Overview

Social proof landing page. Ideal for marketing, conversão, lead gen. AI-ready template. Robert Cialdini nailed it in 1984: people look to others when they're uncertain. Social proof isn't a marketing trick — it's a cognitive shortcut baked into how we make decisions. The enterprise B2B world took decades to internalize this. For years, these pages led with features, specs, jargon. Nobody cared.

The shift happened somewhere around 2015-2018. Stripe put client logos above the fold. Slack showed user counts. Suddenly every SaaS landing page had that grayscale logo bar — you know the one. Five to seven logos, desaturated, evenly spaced. It became visual shorthand for 'we're legit.' Some designers hate it. But it works, and the data backs it up consistently.

The 2020s pushed this further. Now it's not just logos — it's named testimonials with headshots, video case studies, specific metrics ('saved 40 hours/month'). The proof got granular. B2B buyers are skeptical by default; they've been burned before. Leading with evidence rather than promises became the dominant pattern for pages selling anything above $10k ARR.
